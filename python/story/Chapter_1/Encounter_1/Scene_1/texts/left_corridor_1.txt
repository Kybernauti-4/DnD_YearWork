You chose to go left. Hmmm, interesting choice. One wonders
what made you choose this route. Well whatever, you made the right choice.
You have walked into the armory and you stumbled upon a weapon
that peaked your interest. The sword almost looked at you with it's shine.
Will you pick up the weapon?
